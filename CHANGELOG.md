# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

-   **API keys move into Obsidian's secret storage** (#1): the OpenAI and Gemini keys are no longer kept in the plugin's `data.json` (which Obsidian Sync and vault backups carry). On first load after updating, an existing key is moved into Settings → General → Secrets (`similar-notes-openai-api-key`, `similar-notes-gemini-api-key`) and removed from `data.json`. The OpenAI and Gemini settings now show a secret picker instead of a text box. Requires Obsidian 1.11.4 or newer; on an older Obsidian the plugin refuses to save or use a key and says so.

### Improved

-   **Large notes no longer fail with the OpenAI provider** (#1): a note whose chunks added up to more than 300,000 tokens was sent as one request, rejected with HTTP 400 on every attempt, and ended up in the errored list. Each note is now sent in requests of at most 2048 inputs and about 100,000 estimated tokens.
-   **Lower memory for large vaults** (#1): the in-memory search index now keeps one compact (Float32Array) copy of each chunk's embedding and no chunk text; the text is read from IndexedDB only for the results shown. For a 1536-dimension model this cuts the index's resident size by roughly two thirds (measured 2.9x smaller for 10,000 chunks).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

-   **Hover preview on similar-note results** (#55): Hovering a note in the Similar notes bottom panel, the sidebar view, or the `;;` link-suggestion popup while holding Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) now shows Obsidian's native page preview, just like hovering a regular link. Uses the Page Preview core plugin, which gains a "Similar Notes" toggle in its settings to control whether the modifier key is required.
-   **Frontmatter-based note exclusion** (#42): Notes can now opt out of indexing from inside the note. Settings → Exclude files from index gains a **Frontmatter properties** input (one rule per line): `key` excludes notes where the property exists, `key: value` excludes notes where the property equals the value or the list contains it — so `tags: noindex`, `categories: [[Private]]`, and `embed: false` all work. The excluded-files preview badges each file with what excluded it (`path` / `frontmatter`), and the **Apply Rules** button syncs the index against both path patterns and frontmatter rules.

### Changed

-   **"Folder patterns" setting renamed to "Path patterns"**: the glob patterns have always matched full file paths (e.g. `Private/secret.md`, `**/drafts/*`), not just folders. The setting's stored value is unchanged.

### Improved

-   **Unchanged indexable notes no longer regenerate embeddings** (#51): Writes that only change excluded frontmatter or regex-filtered content now advance indexing state without rerunning local or API embeddings, reducing unnecessary CPU use and provider calls.
-   **RegExp exclusion tester matches indexing exactly**: an invalid pattern in the list no longer blanks the whole preview — it is skipped with a note, and the remaining patterns still apply, exactly as indexing treats them.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

-   **Export similar notes for active note** (#47): New command **Similar Notes: Export similar notes for active note** writes the current note's similar-notes results to `.obsidian/plugins/similar-notes/similar-notes-export.json`. Lets external tools (e.g. coding agents) reuse the plugin's similarity search without touching embeddings or the index — open a note, run the command, read the JSON. Each result has `path`, `title`, `score`, `excerpt`, and `linked`; the payload carries a `version` for forward compatibility, is written atomically (no partial reads), and on failure reports a stable `code` (`NO_ACTIVE_FILE`, `SEARCH_FAILED`) alongside `ok: false`.

### Changed

-   **Already-linked notes now appear in Similar notes**: previously the panel hid any note the active note already linked to, so the most obvious matches were missing from recommendations. Linked notes now show, ranked by score alongside everything else, with a small muted "linked" tag marking them as already linked. The agent export gains a matching `linked` field per result.
-   **Built-in models on mobile now warn about memory use**: built-in models run entirely on-device and have to hold the whole model in memory, which a phone often can't spare, so on lower-memory devices Obsidian can crash outright. The Built-in model settings now show a warning on mobile recommending a remote provider (Ollama, OpenAI, or Gemini) instead, and the plugin description notes that cloud APIs are recommended on mobile. High-memory phones and tablets can still choose built-in models.

### Improved

-   **Bug reports now include CPU and memory**: the "Copy environment info" output adds your CPU core count, architecture, and total RAM (desktop only). These help diagnose memory- and performance-sensitive issues with the built-in on-device model.

### Fixed

-   **"Copy environment info" now reports OpenAI and Gemini models correctly**: with the model provider set to OpenAI API or Google Gemini, the Debug & Support environment report still showed `Model: Built-in (...)` with the built-in model name, so bug reports misidentified the active model. The report now shows the actual provider and model (e.g. `OpenAI (perplexity/pplx-embed-v1-0.6b)`), and for OpenAI and Ollama providers adds a `Server URL` line so reports distinguish real OpenAI, OpenRouter, and local servers.
-   **Built-in model no longer crashes when indexing large notes** (with GPU acceleration off): the on-device model could fail with a bare number (e.g. `8934496`) in the Errored files list, and once it hit one problem note the rest of the vault tended to fail too. The cause was embedding all of a note's chunks in a single pass; on a large note (e.g. a long config or README) that one pass exceeded the on-device engine's memory limit and aborted it. That limit is fixed and independent of how much RAM you have, so a powerful desktop was affected just like a small machine. Notes are now embedded in smaller batches, so a single large note can no longer exhaust the limit. Any crash that still occurs now shows a readable message instead of a bare number. After updating, retry the affected notes (Index settings → Retry errored, or Reindex).
-   **Hiding the ribbon icon now sticks across restarts** (#50): if you hid the Similar Notes icon from the left ribbon (right-click → uncheck), it came back every time you reopened Obsidian. The icon was registered too late in startup to receive Obsidian's "hidden ribbon items" preference, so it always reappeared. It now registers early like core plugins, so a hidden icon stays hidden.
-   **Clicking the ribbon icon during startup no longer opens an empty pane** (#50): registering the icon early (above) briefly made it clickable before the plugin finished loading, which could open a blank Similar Notes pane. It now shows a "still loading" notice until the view is ready.
-   **"Copy environment info" now reports your current settings**: the Debug & Support "Copy to Clipboard" button captured settings once when the settings tab was opened, so after switching the model (or toggling an option like GPU / Include Frontmatter) the copied report showed a stale value, usually the model from one or two changes earlier. It now reads your settings at click time, so bug reports match what you actually have selected.
-   **Better recommendations for long, multi-topic notes on large-context models**: chunk size was tied to the embedding model's context window, so with a large-context model (e.g. Ollama `bge-m3`, OpenAI) a long note mixing several topics was split into chunks so coarse that any single topic's signal was averaged away. Genuinely related notes were then missed, or buried under unrelated notes that merely shared structure (tables, headings). Notes are now chunked at a focused semantic size regardless of the model. In testing, a long note covering many topics now surfaces a focused related note clearly at the top, with the matching passage as the excerpt, where before it ranked only marginally above unrelated notes. **Run a full reindex** (Index settings → Reindex) on existing vaults to apply the finer chunking.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

-   **Semantic Link Suggestions in the Editor** (#35): Type a trigger (default `;;`) followed by a description to get semantic note suggestions inline and insert a `[[link]]`
    -   Same inline dropdown as Obsidian's `[[` linker — type a rough description (e.g. `;;book with zombie`) and pick the note you meant, even when you've forgotten its exact title
    -   Selecting a result replaces the `;;…` text with a `[[wikilink]]` at your cursor
    -   New "Semantic link trigger" field under Display settings — change the trigger (e.g. `@@`) or leave it empty to disable. The trigger is standalone (not `[[`) so Obsidian's built-in link autocomplete is left untouched
-   **Errored notes are visible and retryable** (#45, #46): Notes that fail to index now appear under a new "Errored files" list in the Index settings, with the error reason — separate from excluded files. A "Retry errored" button (also in the status-bar menu and as a "Retry errored notes" command) re-attempts them after you fix the cause (e.g. switch model, restore Ollama). Editing a note retries it automatically.

### Changed

-   **Index settings reorganized**: The single crowded Index section is split into three focused sections. **Index** keeps statistics, indexing delay, Include frontmatter, Reindex, and the errored-files list (Reindex now sits after the two indexing options instead of between them). **Exclude folders from index** holds the folder/glob patterns, the excluded-files preview, and the Apply action (renamed from "Apply exclusion patterns" to **"Apply folder patterns"**, since it only adds/removes files by folder pattern — content patterns take effect on reindex). **Exclude content from index** holds the content-regex field and its RegExp tester (the field now appears above the tester, previously below it).
-   **Excalidraw excluded from indexing by default** (#46): New installs now skip the default `Excalidraw/` folder. Excalidraw drawings are stored as base64-compressed binary data that can't be embedded and isn't meaningful to search. Existing users' exclusion settings are unchanged — remove the pattern if you want those files indexed.

### Improved

-   **Faster Ollama indexing** (#46): A note's chunks are now embedded in batched requests instead of one network round-trip per chunk, so indexing on Ollama is quicker — most noticeable on large vaults and with small-context models (which split notes into many chunks).

### Fixed

-   **Non-English notes failing to index on Ollama** (#46): Notes with Korean/CJK (or other multi-byte) content could fail to index with an "input length exceeds the context" error. The chunk-size estimate assumed English-length tokens and packed far too much text into each chunk for the model's context window. The estimate is now based on UTF-8 byte length, so chunks stay within the model's limit regardless of script.
-   **Token-dense notes failing to index on Ollama** (#46): Notes packed with tables, numbers, code, or file paths could still fail with an "input length exceeds the context length" error — even after the byte-based estimate above — because that content tokenizes into more tokens than any byte estimate predicts, overflowing the model's context window. Two changes fix it: indexing now uses Ollama's modern `/api/embed` endpoint with truncation enabled, so an over-long chunk is trimmed to fit instead of failing the whole note; and chunk size is now capped against the model's real context length (read from the model info), not just an empirical size probe. For these documents, `bge-m3` (8K context) and `nomic-embed-text` (2K) have the most headroom.
-   **Honest indexing status** (#45, #46): Indexing failures are no longer hidden. The plugin previously reported the whole vault as indexed — and lumped failed notes into the "Excluded" count — even when notes had silently failed to index. The Index settings now show separate **Indexed / Errored / Excluded** counts, and the status bar shows how many notes errored. A note is retried a few times before being marked errored, and a terminally-errored note is no longer re-attempted on every restart (which previously crashed at the same point each launch).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

-   **Create Note from Semantic Search** (#37): Press Shift+Enter in the semantic search popup (Ctrl+Shift+O) to create a new note named after your query
    -   Mirrors Obsidian's Quick Switcher — type a rough title, create the note, refine the title later
    -   If a note with that name already exists, it opens the existing note instead of creating a duplicate

### Changed

-   **Semantic Search Shortcuts Reworked** (#37): Aligned with Obsidian's Quick Switcher
    -   "Insert as link" moved from Shift+Enter / Shift+Click to **Alt+Enter / Alt+Click** (Shift+Enter now creates a note)
    -   Inserting a link no longer closes the popup, so you can insert several links in a row (Alt+Enter, navigate, Alt+Enter, …) and press Esc when done

### Fixed

-   **Major Memory Leak on Reload** (#8): The embedding model's Web Worker was never terminated when the plugin unloaded or reloaded, leaving the loaded model in memory (potentially several GB) and accumulating across reloads. The worker is now terminated on unload, reclaiming that memory
-   **Ollama Server URL Input** (#43): The server URL field no longer loses focus after each typed character — you can now type the full URL normally

### Changed

-   **New Plugin Icon** (#39): Ribbon, sidebar tab, and status bar now use a telescope icon
    -   Replaces the previous "files" icon, which visually collided with Obsidian's copy and insert-template buttons

### Improved

-   **Faster File Renames** (#39): Moving a file between folders no longer triggers full re-embedding
    -   Embeddings are now preserved on pure renames; only the indexed path is updated

### Fixed

-   **Sidebar Now Clears on Note Close** (#39): Stale recommendations no longer linger after closing the active note or switching to a non-markdown file
-   **Clear Error for Missing Local Models** (#38): Model loads that fail because ONNX files are missing now show an actionable error instead of a generic "Network error"

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
